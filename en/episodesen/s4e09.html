<p style="text-align:center;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-6">Nathaniel and Marc have a plan for Marinette to declare her feelings to Adrien. They set it up at school, where Adrien is free of his father's control. But Chloé films their meeting and threatens to reveal everything to Gabriel, who would forbid Adrien to go back to school. Chloé will spend the evening at Gabriel's, where Marinette cannot enter. But Nath and Marc's imagination is limitless, and Marinette, disguised as waitress, sneaks into the Agreste home... where a supervillain is also crashing the party. Will Ladybug save the soirée?</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;color:red;font-weight:bold;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">PLOT</p>
<p style="text-align:center; padding:20px;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-6">The episode starts with Shadow Moth in his lair, saying that something has changed since Ladybug has become the Guardian of the Miraculouses and he is determined to find out what is it. Back in the Repository, Gabriel is standing in front of Emilie Agreste's cryogenic pod and is holding one of the Graham de Vanily Twin Rings and says that this evening he had arranged a soirée, in which her sister, Amelie and his nephew, Félix are also invited and he will take the other ring from him which is rightfully his.
<br><br>
The scene changes to a car, in which Amelie and her son, Félix, are travelling in. Félix is watching the Ladyblog on his tablet, and Alya is explaining about Miraculouses and their power. Félix says to his mother he wishes that he would be able to see superheroes and his mother agrees with this by saying that it would be great and gives Félix an air kiss. In Nathalie's room, Adrien brings food on a cart tray for Nathalie, to which she says thank you for bringing food. Adrien sits on the side of the bed and says that his father is not allowing him to invite his friends from school. Nathalie says that there will be Kagami and Chloé in that soirée, to which Adrien replies that they are members of his father's club. Nathalie explains that the members of the club are the most influential people of Paris, which are important to his father, but Adrien sadly replies that his friends are most important to him. Then Gabriel enters the room and tells Adrien to leave to which he sadly obeys and leaves the room. Gabriel sits beside Nathalie and says that without her arranging a soirée is quite difficult and he now realizes that she is irreplaceable. He says that he couldn't cancel the event because the guests wouldn't understand his condition. So to help him, Nathalie provides him with a tablet that contains a set of instructions that will help him to arrange the soirée. Nathalie then asks him that whether he had lunch, by offering him a sandwich. Gabriel replies that he hasn't yet eaten and happily accepts the sandwich by saying thank you.
<br><br>
In Art classroom, Marinette is sitting alongside Rose, Juleka, Alix, Mylène and Zoé. Then Alya comes along with Marc and Nathaniel and says to Marinette that they will help her to confess her love to Adrien. Marinette gets horrified and tells Alya why she had shared her secret with them, but the others tell that they already know that she has a crush on Adrien. Alya tells her that they are specialists in romantic comedy stories and they will help her to express her love to Adrien. Rose tells that their first story about the love story of Ladybug and Cat Noir. Marc and Nathaniel begin to explain their story and tell them, that the story is complicated from the outside but in reality is very simple, like a fairy tale. As in a fairy tale, a princess is captured by a witch, which traps her in a castle, guarded by a dragon and a knight must come to save him. They explain that in this story, the princess is Adrien, the knight is Marinette, the castle is the Agreste Mansion and the witch is his father. Then they explain that to be their plan to be successful, it has to take place, where Gabriel has not any control on his son, and that place is their school.
<br><br>
Then suddenly, a part of the classroom's roof falls and reveals Chloé and Sabrina descending by harnesses and they reveal that they have recorded the whole meeting and intends to show it to Gabriel, so he will lock his son at home and he will never again allow his son to go to the school. Marinette tells her that she was happy when he came to school, to which Chloé replies that it would be better for him to be away from a bunch of losers. She then tells Sabrina to produce a ninja smokescreen, to which she throws a pouch of flour and goes back from the roof's hole, but in the way, Chloé collides with the roof.
<br><br>
Marinette then tells her friends that Chloé will not able to do anything because Gabriel doesn't allow anybody to enter his house. But then Zoé tells her that, today Gabriel has arranged a soiré, in which Chloé is also invited. To this Marinette tells Zoé that if Chloé is invited, then Zoé can also go to that soirée and stop Chloé from showing that meeting footage to Gabriel. But Zoé says that Chloé has somehow convinced her mother to leave Zoé at the home. Marinette gets disappointed, but Marc says her not to worry, the knight will stop Chloé from showing that video to Gabriel. When Zoé asks that how it will happen since the knight hasn't the invitation to the soirée, to which Marc says that knight will have to wear a disguise, in order to enter the soirée, to which Marinette gets delighted.
<br><br>
At the Le Grand Paris, Zoé is sitting on the sofa. Just then, Butler Jean, enters the room with a tray full of crockeries. Zoé stands up and in and asks Butler Jean, rudely, that if her mother told him that the soirée is no longer being held at the Gabriel Agreste's mansion to which he replies not that her mother didnt tell him , to which she replies a helicopter will arrive at the roof, to take Butler Jean to the Eiffel Tower. When Butler Jean asks her that is she sure about this, Zoé gets angry at him and says me wrong ? I am never wrong then she walks away and he looks at her and sighs, but Zoé silently says to herself that she is Sorry ,but it is for a good cause then she calls the friends on phone as they are all in Marinette's room Zoé then says the Butler is out of the picture.</p>
