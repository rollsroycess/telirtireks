<p style="text-align:center;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-6">Ladybug and Cat Noir face Glaciator again, who is convinced that the superheroes are in love. When a facetious Cat Noir agrees with him, Ladybug reminds him that they cannot be together, and that insistence is becoming a real nuisance. Once they've defeated the supervillain, Cat Noir starts doing some serious soul-searching. As he looks for a way to stop annoying his Lady with his feelings, Cat Noir bumps into Marinette, who herself is looking for someone to help her rehearse telling how she feels to the boy she secretly loves...</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;color:red;font-weight:bold;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">PLOT</p>
<p style="text-align:center; padding:20px;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-6">Ladybug and Cat Noir once again face Glaciator. Cat Noir rescues a man who is reading a magazine from being hit by Glaciator, while Ladybug saves a firefighter from getting hit as well. Both remark to the heroes that they make a great couple, leaving Cat Noir a bit confused and Ladybug annoyed, and clarifies that she and Cat Noir are not a couple, just partners, and leaves. At the Place Des Vosges, the heroes are shielding someone, who remarks that love is great. This annoys Ladybug once again, and asks what is up with people these days and says they are not in love. Glaciator then interrupts her, saying that they can't deny it and it is in the news. He then shows her a poster of their kiss (from Oblivio) which shocks Ladybug. She then looks around and sees that they have gone viral. They learn that they have been voted "Couple of the Year" from a magazine a park keeper was holding, much to Ladybug's fury. Glaciator then declares that this is proof that his ice cream never lies and that the two are made for each other, which infuriates her once more and explains that the photos taken are out of context. Cat Noir then explains to Ladybug that maybe Glaciator is right, but she shuts him down. He then begins flirting with Ladybug once again, prompting her to throw him inside the trash can in a fit of rage. Ladybug then turns her attention back to Glaciator and single-handedly defeats him quickly, to Cat Noir's shock. Andr√©, now de-akumatized, then tries reasoning with Ladybug, to no avail. Ladybug swings away with Cat Noir.
<br><br>
On the rooftops, Cat Noir is still inside the trash can and comes out, facing an annoyed Ladybug. Cat Noir then offers her to go with him to a movie to make up for infuriating her earlier, or to a restaurant to celebrate being the "Couple of the Year". Ladybug then finally shouts at him, saying they are not a couple at all, which shocks Cat Noir, who finally apologizes and then says that he has his own feelings that he can't control. Ladybug calms down, then tells him that she knows his heart is in the right place and that he doesn't mean any harm. Cat Noir then sadly interrupts, saying that he'll stop and that he doesn't know how to yet, but he'll figure it out. Ladyug smiles and says she's counting on him. The two separate.
<br><br>
In the Agreste mansion, Cat Noir detransforms into Adrien. He then tells Plagg, who is eating Camembert, that Ladybug is right, that he can't force his feelings on her and that he needs to change. He then deletes all his photos of Ladybug on his phone and computer and looks down sadly.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, inside the Cesaire apartment, in Alya's room, Alya is being forced to delete all the photos of Ladybug and Cat Noir by Marinette, to her shock. She then tells Marinette that she can't do this to her, but Marinette stands her ground, and Alya sadly deletes the photos. The disappearance of the photos is reported on the news by Nadja Chamack, and reads some of the questions asked by the people, one of them asks if Ladybug and Cat Noir are no longer an "item". In her room, after seeing this, Marinette then growls angrily and grabs her computer, and shouts that they were never an item. Adrien also watched the news, but turns the TV off and sadly looks down.
<br><br>

At Coll√®ge Fran√ßoise Dupont, during fencing practice, Adrien is easily defeated by a fencer, due to his lack of concentration and sadly walks to the locker room. Noticing this, Kagami offers to help him after fencing practice, but Adrien refuses, saying that no one can help him and leaves, leaving her concerned.
<br><br>
While on the way home, Adrien begins to cry, and asks for his bodyguard to stop at Place Des Vosges. He gets out of the car and walks to the park, and starts to cry. After seeing a poster of him and Ladybug, he gets emotional once again and continues crying.
<br><br>
Shadow Moth's lair then opens, sensing a negative emotion. But while in the process of creating an akuma, he suddenly notices that the negative emotions belong to Adrien. He lets go of the akuma and detransforms into Gabriel, who calls his bodyguard reminding him that his task was to drive Adrien home immediately after fencing practice.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in her balcony, Marinette is angrily calling someone, through phone call, to tear the posters down and while looking at it, calls it "visual pollution". She then asks how much would it cost to tear down the posters and is shocked to find out. Marinette then spots Adrien in a bench and distractedly ends her call and rushes into her room to find a present for Adrien.
<br><br>
Marinette then pretends walking in the park, ending it when Adrien notices. She struggles trying to tell him that she noticed he was sad but finally hands him a gift in red wrapping paper. As Adrien opens it up, he happily starts to tell Marinette how much he loves hamsters since the gift he received was a hamster wheel. Marinette then begins to daydream about her telling Adrien that she loves him, but is interrupted when she realizes that she gave Adrien the wrong gift, stops her daydream and throws the box in a nearby trashcan. When Adrien starts to object that he a gift like that would've been cool and useful, Marinette cuts him off by saying that it wasn't cool or useful and useless things like that belong in the trash for people to forget about them. Adrien sadly agrees and walks away. Marinette groans in frustration for feeling that she messed things up, when suddenly the Tsurugi Car honks from the other side of the park.
<br><br>
At the Agreste Manor, Gabriel asks to speak to Adrien after noticing Adrien was sad. He tells Adrien that if Adrien ever wanted to talk then he could confide in him. Adrien then tells Gabriel that if he ever needed to, then he would and leaves. As Adrien enters his room, Plagg is amazed that Gabriel said something with such warm feelings that it's enough to melt a wheel of raclette cheese. Adrien starts to get upset because he doesn't want to become like his father who he claims is tied to a memory of something that can never be, and transforms into Chat Noir
<br><br>
Back at the park, Kagami is worried that Adrien is heartbroken and persuades Marinette to confess her feelings to Adrien by practicing on another boy who is not in love with her. Once Marinette steps out of the car, Tikki volunteers for Marinette to practice on her. Marinette thanks to tikki but declines because she feels that she needs a human boy to practice on.
<br><br>
While Chat Noir is busy cataclysming billboards of him and Ladybug, Marinette is busy struggling to think of a boy to practice on. Soon she spots him and calls him over then asks him to play the part of her boyfriend who isn't her boyfriend yet. As Marinette begins reading her confession, Chat Noir interrupts her because he thinks that she actually has feelings for him when she said his name. They then begin to discuss a fill in name to say when Marinette is reading her letter, Chat Noir suggests that she use her actual crush's name but Marinette claims that it is private. So then, Marinette decides on using 'Buttercup' as a code name, which also makes Chat Noir laughs. They take a second for Chat Noir to stop laughing, and Marinette starts again. Only to be interrupted again by Chat Noir who starts laughing again. Who says that the name is making him cackle. After he clears his throat, Marinette tries once more to read her confession but is then distracted when looking at Chat Noir's face and realizes his facial expression is quite odd. Marinette asks if he is hurt or something but Chat Noir claims that it is his serious face, which Marinette then tells him to be serious but not too serious because he looks like he is trying to solve a math problem. This time, Marinette starts up again but a little more aggressive and is interrupted by Chat Noir who asks what face he should make instead. Frustrated, Marinette screams out that she doesn't care and tells him that she just wants him to pretend to be interested in her for the sake of her training and pushes him back in his seat. Even more aggravated then before, Marinette begins to repeat her script but with more aggression and Chat Noir attempts to flatter her, but over does it. Marinette still a bit furious, tries to be enthusiastic and joyful, Cat Noir rises up from his seat by telling her dramatically that her poem is the most beautiful thing someone ever said to him, but Marinette unflattered adds that she barely said anything, Cat Noir tells Marinette that the way she opens her mouth is so moving, and that it was like "the skies after the storm, like a rainbow sweeping my heart". Marinette still unflattered objects by telling him that he's overdoing it. She repeats herself furiously, Cat Noir instantly rises from his seat and an aggravated Marinette asks him what is the problem now, feeling her anger, Chat Noir mentions that he thinks that she is more mad at him than in love with him, Cat Noir says that it could be more obvious. Marinette who's extremely mad tells him that if he's so good at it, he should try to do it, swaps their positions and pushes the script into his hands. Cat Noir starts reciting and Marinette, looking a bit impressed, asks him if she sounds that corny while doing it, but Cat Noir says that he's just performing. Marinette slaps herself lightly and tells herself that this is awful and she won't be able to do it. Cat Noir reassures her by saying that she puts too much pressure on herself and they should take a small break. They both decide that they should go to the movies.
<br><br>
While boarding the bus, Marinette asks Cat Noir if something's wrong. He tells her that he mostly travels by stick meaning that he doesn't have money to pay for the ride, but the driver tells him not to worry because he saved them so many times it's the least he could do in return. As they reach their seats, the pair suggest movies to watch at the movie theater. Marinette mentions a movie called, "Little Love Notes", but rejects it because she claims they'd rather not watch a romantic comedy so they can't think of their personal feelings. Chat Noir then suggests to not watch a movie about superheros as well. They come to the solution of the movie, "Sharktank vs. Mechatiger" which the title starts to make them laugh. As the bus passes by Andre, who is nearby, he notices the two teens chuckling together and begins to frown.
<br><br>
Inside the movie theater, Chat Noir questions how the characters in the movie are supposed to kiss since they don't have mouths. Marinette answers by saying that the movie is planned in advance but in real life, no one actually knows how things are supposed to go, and just because you tell someone that you love them that it doesn't mean they will actually like you back. Chat Noir agrees with her about the fact that love is not easy.
