<p style="text-align:center;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-6">Because of a plan thought up by Marinette, Shadow Moth akumatizes two villains. Ladybug and Cat Noir will need help to stop the evil duo.</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:center;color:red;font-weight:bold;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">PLOT</p>
<p style="text-align:center; padding:20px;" class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-6">The Episode begins at the Liberty, where Kitty Section's members are rehearsing. After they complete rehearsals, Luka asks everyone about why Marinette wasn't there and if she is okay. Alya tells him that Marinette was alright, but was a little busy. Luka tries to say they can tell him the truth, and acknowledges that Marinette knows he still loves her. Rose makes an excuse, saying Marinette had water-pony classes at the time. Luka then leaves. Everyone stares at Rose while Alya sarcastically claps at her. Rose tries explaining she couldn't "tell the truth because it would break his heart. Marinette feels embarrassed when she is in front of him," and they need to fix it. Mylène says they have to figure out a way for Marinette and Luka to be together again, at least as friends. Together, they conspire where Marinette and Luka should meet. Zoé suggests somewhere Marinette needs to go. Ivan and Nino suggests a place where they have to talk. Alya then suggests that instead of the cinema they were going to on Saturday with the intent to watch Rock and Monster Parade, they cancel and have a party in the boat instead for the Juleka and Luka's Birthday. Everyone agrees with her and assigns themselves a task for the party accordingly.
<br><br>
Since Alya decided she would bring Marinette to the party, Alya talks to Marinette in her room about inviting her to Juleka's birthday with the original movie plan. Unknown to Marinette, Alya is tricking Marinette into believing it's only Juleka's birthday, whereas the Couffaine siblings are twins. Marinette falls for it at first, but she quickly realizes Alya tricked her into going to a party when they arrive at the boat. Alya explains to Marinette that she is wrong about Luka and that everything will be fine. She also says they can be friends if they can't be together. Marinette reminds Alya that Luka has already been akumatized twice because of her and feels bad about it. Alya says that Marinette can create Magical charms as Ladybug and that everything will be okay, insisting she has to do this because it is her duty. Marinette agrees, but internally she neither wants to see Luka nor be his friend. At Collège Françoise Dupont, by hiding behind a bin, Marinette runs to Juleka. She says Alya insisted she has to come to the party, but Luka will be there and she doesn't want to see him. She then makes an excuse to Juleka that she doesn't want to come because she wants to avoid akumatizations on her birthday. Juleka tells Marinette she would do what she could. Marinette happily thanks her in advance, hugs her, and runs off.
<br><br>
At the Liberty, Juleka starts telling Luka that Marinette is coming to their birthday party but she doesn't want him there. As soon as she says Marinette is coming, he gets excited and feels happy about it. Juleka nervously stops the conversation. Luka senses Juleka is sad but is interrupted by a knock at their window. Unknown to Luka, she feels guilty because Luka becomes involved in the party. When Luka opens the window, Jagged Stone enters their room. Originally, he wanted to meet Luka. They both discuss music, whereas Juleka says hi but is unnoticed. Luka and Jagged continue talking but Anarka Couffaine angrily interrupts them, claiming she doesn't want outsiders (Jagged Stone) on the boat. Luka asks Anarka if Jagged can come to their birthday party, which Anarka replies only if Juleka agrees with it too. Jagged is surprised at seeing Juleka behind the window and apologizes that he didn't see her there. Anarka asks Juleka if she wants him at the party, which Juleka agrees to as she does want him there. Jagged leaves. Meanwhile, Juleka receives two calls: one from Alya with Rose, Alix, and Mylène, asking if Luka will be there for the party, and one from Marinette asking if Luka won't be there. Juleka becomes really confused and very aggressive over the guilt she has from not telling Luka about what Marinette said her.
<br><br>
Alya arrives at the Liberty with Marinette, Nino, Rose, Mylène and Zoé. Alya is admitting to Marinette she is really very impressed that she came there, and telling Marinette she didn't thought Marinette would come calmly and meet Luka, and says Marinette is brave. Unknown to Alya, Marinette actually tend to get rid of Luka from the party as she asked Juleka to do it. Marinette overs the situation, and says you have to overcome things in life, by growing up. Marinette secretly whispers to Juleka and asks if she really did what she told to do; Eventually sees Luka there playing guitar, and get overwhelmed with the situation. Luka says hi to Marinette, but Marinette runs over from there by saying she have to do something and she is super urgent, Good Evening. While running, Marinette accidentally jumped inside the boat from the rooftop. Luka asks if everything is fine with Marinette, while Juleka is feeling very guilty inside. Everyone starts asking questions about Marinette, and Juleka runs over from there too and explains what's happening today. Whereas Luka says that he knew it, that Marinette doesn't like him anymore, that she doesn't even want to be friends, which Juleka wasn't brave enough to tell him earlier. Luka sadly sits back, and start playing sad music with his guitar.
<br><br>
Shadow Moth senses the emotions of Luka, cruelly disappointed ,and wanting his friendship with his last-loved back. Shadow Moth corrupts the butterfly to Akuma and orders it to fly and evilize the emotions, but the Akuma wasn't able to akumatize him anymore as everyone relieved Luka by telling him she doesn't hate him, she is just being Marinette. Shadow Moth seems a bit worried and disappointed, noticing how weirdly his negative emotions are gone. Shadow Moth orders his akuma to be there as he says the party with teenagers always has a lot of emotions. Meanwhile, Juleka is worried inside the liberty and gets noticed by Marinette who is hiding behind the table. Marinette whispers Juleka, and she came closer to Marinette. Marinette asks why Luka is here, Juleka sadly remains silent. Marinette sees Juleka's sadness and tends to relieve Juleka, asking and telling that she can't tell him. Shadow Moth senses Juleka's emotions and tries to akumatize her. Before something happens, Marinette relieves Juleka by apologizing for stressing her out over something nearly impossible for her. Once again, the Akuma wasn't able to akumatize Juleka because her negative emotions had been erased, much to Shadow Moth's disappointment.
<br><br>
At the party, when everyone dances, Jagged Stone arrives and apologizes Luka that he is late for it. When everyone learn that Jagged is Luka's father, they are surprised. Shadow Moth senses the teenagers' emotions and tries to akumatize them. Again, the Akuma wasn't able to akumatize Marinette's friends because they are overjoyed, and they continue to party. Meanwhile, in the boat, when Juleka tells Marinette that Jagged is her father, she is very surprised asking why Jagged doesn't love her but loves Luka more. The two girls notice Luka and Jagged enter the boat, as Jagged gives Luka a bass and tells him not to tell his sister, causing Juleka to be upset again. Shadow Moth senses Juleka's emotions about not being loved by her father and tries to akumatize her again. But before that happens, Marinette comforts Juleka and talks to Jagged about not bringing Juleka a gift. But, surprisingly, Jagged's gift was for Juleka, which is a bass guitar, making Juleka happy and irritating Shadow Moth. As Jagged prepares to show the disc to the kids, Anarka storms in and furiously yells at Jagged for showing her children the disc that resulted in their breakup. Jagged disagrees, but Anarka calls him a pirate, who left two sailors (Juleka and Luka) behind. However, the disagreement between two estranged lovers became a fight, as they begin to fight over the disc, as Marinette, Juleka, and Luka watch in shock.
<br><br>
Shadow Moth finally senses how upset Jagged and Anarka are towards each other, so he sends the akuma towards them. It infects the disc. The fight ends with Jagged and Anarka ripping it in a fit of rage, and are akumatized by Shadow Moth, back into their original akumatized selves, Guitar Villain and Captain Hardrock, joining forces to become Crocoduel, still fighting each other.
<br><br>
The teens all evacuate the boat as they all watch in shock Crocoduel getting akumatized and fighting each other. Marinette whispers to Alya that she needs help to slip away. Alya pretends to hurt her ankle and gets the attention of others, whilst Marinette escapes and transforms into Ladybug. The other teens leave with Alya while Luka and Juleka watch their akumatized parents still fight each other. Ladybug arrives at the scene and jumps into the top of the Eiffel Tower. She flings her yo-yo at Guitar Villain, but he dodges, and he and Captain Hardrock taunt her. Shadow Moth then orders the villains to seize her Miraculous, and both race for it as Ladybug escapes, looking for Cat Noir.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a stylist is putting makeup on Adrien when suddenly, they hear a loud noise and come out from the dressing room to see the two villains chasing Ladybug. The stylist tells Adrien to take shelter while Ladybug and Cat Noir deal with the situation, but Adrien tells her to go find safety and he'll finish the makeup by himself. The stylist fawns over Adrien, even calling him a pro before scampering off. Once the stylist is gone, Adrien transforms into Cat Noir.
<br><br>
Crocoduel continues to chase after Ladybug, until Captain Hardrock fires a big boulder at Ladybug and it hits her. Crocoduel corners Ladybug and threatens her to give up her Miraculous, even bickering over who gets it, but is interrupted when Cat Noir arrives and hits both of them. He then asks Ladybug to promise that they wouldn't be like that when they're an old couple, but Ladybug explains for it to happen they have to be a couple first. The heroes escape and Crocoduel chases after them. Cat Noir hits Guitar Villain with his staff. He then falls down, but is caught in time by the crocodile. Captain Hardrock taunts him, saying that he won't let the two "house pets" beat them and laughs. When she turns around, Ladybug is gone and wonders where she went. Just then, Ladybug lands on the bow of the ship and prepares to attack, when suddenly Guitar Villain prepares to attack her, but she dodges, landing down at the Place de la Concorde, where Cat Noir catches up with her. Crocoduel leaves them there to fight again, but not before they hear Cat Noir complain that they don't have any wings or a flying pirate ship.
<br><br>
Up in the sky, Crocoduel continues to face off. Captain Hardrock taunts Guitar Villain, saying that he only cared about his music, and he adds their music. They attack each other again but miss. In his lair, Shadow Moth sighs and says that they'll tire of this eventually.</p>
